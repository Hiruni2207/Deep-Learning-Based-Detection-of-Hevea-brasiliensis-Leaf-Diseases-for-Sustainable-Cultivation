# ðŸŒ¿ Deep Learning-Based Detection of *Hevea brasiliensis* Leaf Diseases for Sustainable Cultivation

This project focuses on the early detection and classification of rubber plant (*Hevea brasiliensis*) leaf diseases using deep learning techniques. By automating disease identification through image analysis, this tool supports sustainable rubber cultivation by enabling early intervention and reducing crop loss.
